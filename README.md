 *  Timebase 0.1 ms - 0.5 sec
 *  Single shot
 *  Storage
 *  Index

###Using
 The icons on the toolbar are, from left to right:
 
 *  **Bright line** Defeats the sync and single shot
 *  **Single shot** Touch the trigger icon to get a trace
 *  **Trigger** Touch for a trace
 *  **Sync polarity** Reverses the sync polarity
 *  **Timebase** Drops a submenu of timebase timings
 *  **Storage** Does not clear the display between traces
 *  **Clear** Clears the display
 *  **Left** Moves the trace to the left
 *  **Right** Moves the trace to the right
 *  **Start** Moves the trace to the start
 *  **End** Moves the trace to the ends
 *  **Settings** Just an **About** item

Touching the display will produce a vertical index line, which will show the value at that point. The value is arbitrary, as there is automatic gain control on the input so the trace does not get clipped. The position of the index can be finely adjusted by rolling the finger tip. The index can be removed by wiping it off to the left, or touching the Start icon.

In single shot mode the timebase may be changed to zoom in and pan left and right using the right and left icons.
